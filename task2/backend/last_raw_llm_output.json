      "summary": "The contract is a simple token implementation, likely an ERC20 standard token contract that defines functions for minting, transferring, and querying the total supply of tokens.",
      "security": "Security risks include potential unchecked inputs (e.g., lack of validation for `_to` address in `transferFrom()` function), reentrancy vulnerabilities due to unguarded internal calls (e.g., using `transfer()` or `approve()` without proper checks and locks), and the contract may not have sufficient access control mechanisms in place."
