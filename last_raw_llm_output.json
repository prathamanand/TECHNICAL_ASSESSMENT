      "summary": "This contract is a simple token implementation based on ERC20 standard, with functions to transfer tokens and get the total supply.",
      "security": "Potential security risks include unchecked inputs for transfer function (caller could exceed allowable amount), lack of access control (anyone can call transfer and totalSupply functions), and possible integer overflow in transfer when receiving more than the available token balance."
